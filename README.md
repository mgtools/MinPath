# MinPath
MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways) is a parsimony approach for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, achieving a more conservative, yet more faithful, estimation of the biological pathways for a query dataset.

KEGG and MetaCyc pathways included in Minpath were updated as of May 10, 2021. 

See readme file for usages.
